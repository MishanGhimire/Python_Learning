## Problem: Determine if a fruit is ripe, overripe, or unripe based on its color. (e.g., Banana: Green - Unripe, Yellow - Ripe, Brown - Overripe)
fruit = "Banana"
color = "Yellow"

if fruit == "Banana":
    if color == "Green":
        print("Unripe")
    elif color == "Yellow":
        print("Ripe")
    elif color == "Brown":
        print("OverRipe")
